GitHub copy of the Walk Score Plugin for Wordpress.

Why? Git rules.
* I like to work with Git incrementally and push major releases to the official WP plugin SVN repo.
* A git option may make contributing more appealing to some GitHub lovin' code monkeys.

If you just want to install this plugin in your Wordpress install,
I suggest doing so from the admin panel Plugins > Add New...just search for 'Walk Score'. 
This will provide automatic update notifications and make sure you're using a release version, 
not some wonky bleeding edge development version ;)

If you really like manually installing your WordPress plugins or want to read documentation:
