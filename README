GitHub copy of the Walk Score Plugin for Wordpress.
Why? Becuase git rules. I like to work with Git incrementally and push major releases to the official WP plugin SVN repo. So, if you are using this copy consider it the beta/bleeding edge version (and thus not supported). If you're nervous, confused or unsure, head over to http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/walk-score/
